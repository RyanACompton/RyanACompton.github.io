It’s been a busy few weeks. Had a great time presenting my work at the  <a href="https://www.mun.ca/economics/research/acea-2025/">  Atlantic Canada Economics Association Conference </a> in St. John's Newfoundland. Thanks to <a href="http://www.derekmessacar.com/">  Derek Messacar </a> for organizing a great event. Also had a super time in Ottawa at the <a href= "https://www.defenceandsecurityeconomicsworkshop.ca/"> Defence and Security Economics Workshop </a>. Big thanks to my fellow <a href="https://www.defenceandsecurityeconomicsworkshop.ca/organizers"> organizers </a> for putting on a super workshop.
