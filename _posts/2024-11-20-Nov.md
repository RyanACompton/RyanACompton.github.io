---
It's been a busy few weeks. Had a great time presenting my work at the <a href="https://economics.acadiau.ca/atlantic-canada-economics-association.html"> Atlantic Canada Economics Association</a> Conference in Halifax. Thanks to  <a href="https://www.smu.ca/research/profiles/faculty/Dilmaghani34.html"> Maryam Dilmaghani </a> for organzining a great event. Also had a super time in Ottawa at the <a href="https://www.defenceandsecurityeconomicsworkshop.ca/"> Defence and Security Economics Workshop</a>. Big thanks to my <a href="https://www.defenceandsecurityeconomicsworkshop.ca/organizers"> fellow organizers </a> for putting on a super workshop. Lastly I really enjoyed the <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/events"> 22nd Annual St. Louis Fed Professors Conference </a>. It was great to learn about some of the latest in teaching economics as well as to catch up with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/garyhoovereconomics/"> Gary Hoover (Tulane) </a> and <a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/seidman/facultystaff-directory-195.htm?recordId_1=92F81AFD-B33A-FB3F-A0771B6084528236#E277C63A-5715-217A-5A00D3A0737508AD"> Dan Giedeman (GVSU) </a>.
