The Canadian Development Economics Study Group has launched a new <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cdesg/"> </a> website. This will be a good source for development economics news in Canada. The CDESG organizes the development economics sessions at the CEA meetings and will be doing so again this year for the Vancouver meetings. More information on how to submit papers for that conference are available on the new CDESG website.
