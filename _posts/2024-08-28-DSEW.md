Big thanks to <a href="https://www.metrostate.edu/about/directory/ming-lo"> Ming Lo </a> and  <a href="https://www.metrostate.edu/about/directory/allen-bellas">Allen Bellas</a> for a great time at the Midwest Economic Research Group conference in St. Paul Minnesota this past week. Really fun group and a great chance to receive feedback on my paper Origin Country Conflict and Immigrant Physical Health.
