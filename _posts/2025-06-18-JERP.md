title: "New JERP Impact Factor"
---
Very happy to see that the <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/41996">Journal of Economics, Race, and Policy</a> has received its first journal impact factor, with a score of 1.1. For such a relatively new journal this is great news and only sign of things to come. Please consider the journal for your work!
